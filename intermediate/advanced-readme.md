## Advanced topics in Vue.js:

### 1.  **Dynamic components**: 
Dynamic components allow you to switch between different components based on the state of your application. You can use the 'component' element to dynamically render a component based on a data property[1].

### 2. **Custom directives**:
Custom directives allow you to create reusable code that can be applied to elements in your application. You can create a custom directive using the 'Vue.directive()' method. To use the custom directive, add it to an element using the 'v-' prefix[1].

### 3. **Filters**:
Filters apply formatting and transformations to your data before displaying it. You can filter using the 'Vue.filter()' method. To use the filter, add it to an expression using the pipe '|' symbol[1].

### 4. **Mixins**:
Mixins are a flexible way to share functionality between components. To create a mixin, define an object with the desired properties and methods. Then, use the 'mixins' option to include the mixin in your component[1].

### 5. **Transitions**: 
Transitions allow you to add animations to your components when they are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM. You can use the 'transition' element to wrap your component and specify the animation classes[2].

### 6. **State management**:
Large applications can often grow in complexity, due to multiple pieces of state scattered across many components and the interactions between them. To solve this problem, Vue offers Vuex, which is a state management pattern and library for VueJS applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only get mutated in a predictable fashion[2].

### 7. **Server-side rendering**: 
Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique that allows you to render your Vue.js application on the server and send the HTML to the client. This can improve the performance of your application and make it more SEO-friendly. You can use the 'vue-server-renderer' package to implement SSR in your application[2].

### 8. **Render function**: 
The render function is a powerful feature in Vue.js that allows you to create components programmatically. You can use the 'render' function to define the structure of your component and return a virtual DOM tree[5].

### 9. **Handling events in components**: 
In Vue.js, you can handle events in components using the 'v-on' directive. You can bind the event to a method in your component and pass arguments to the method using the '$event' variable[6].

### 10. **Component assembly**: 
In Vue.js, you can assemble components by nesting them inside each other. You can use the 'props' option to pass data from the parent component to the child component and emit events from the child component to the parent component using the '$emit' method[6].
