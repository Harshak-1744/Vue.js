In Vue.js, an instance is essentially an object that ties together the data, template, and logic necessary to power a Vue application or component. It serves as the root of a Vue app and provides the context in which Vue's reactive data-binding system operates. 

When you create a new Vue instance using `new Vue()`, you're creating an isolated, reusable component. This instance has its own data, methods, lifecycle hooks, and so on. The most basic form of a Vue instance looks like this:

```javascript
var vm = new Vue({
  el: '#app',           // element to mount to
  data: {
    message: 'Hello Vue!'
  }
});
```

Here's a breakdown of the properties:

- `el`: Specifies a DOM element to mount the Vue instance. In this case, Vue will look for an element with the ID of "app" and mount itself there.

- `data`: An object that holds the data for the Vue instance. This is where you define properties that you want to be reactive.

Once you have a Vue instance, you can access its properties and methods using the variable you assigned it to. In the example above, that's the `vm` variable.

```javascript
console.log(vm.message); // logs "Hello Vue!"
```

The Vue instance also exposes several lifecycle hooks, like `created`, `mounted`, `updated`, and `destroyed`, which you can use to run code at specific stages in the component's life.

A Vue application typically starts by creating a root Vue instance with `new Vue()`, which mounts to a DOM element and encompasses the whole app. From there, you can create reusable Vue components, each of which can also be thought of as smaller Vue instances with their own state, methods, and lifecycle.

In essence, the Vue instance serves as the foundation of how Vue's reactive system works, linking the data model to the DOM and allowing for data-driven UI updates.

## Explanation:- 

let's use the metaphor of a television set.

Imagine a television (TV). The TV set itself is like your website.

Now, every TV has a remote control, which allows you to interact with it: change the channel, adjust the volume, turn it on or off, and so on. Think of the "Vue instance" as that remote control for the TV (your website).

1. **Choosing a Channel (the `el` property)**:
   Just as you choose which channel to watch by pressing a button on the remote, in Vue, the `el` property decides which part of your website to show or control.

2. **Setting the Volume or Brightness (the `data` property)**:
   On your TV remote, you can set the volume to your preferred level or adjust the brightness. Similarly, in Vue, the `data` property decides what content or information to display on your website.

3. **Special Buttons (methods and functions)**:
   Some remotes have special buttons to open specific apps or functions. Similarly, with Vue, you can have special functions to do specific things on your website.

Whenever you want to change something on your TV, you don't have to go behind it and mess with the wires. You simply press a button on your remote control. Similarly, with Vue, when developers want to change or control something on the website, they use the Vue instance (the remote) to make those changes.

So, in essence, the "Vue instance" is like a TV remote, allowing developers to control different aspects of the website without needing to tinker with the complex parts behind the scenes.

In summary, just as a TV remote simplifies the control and interaction with a television set, the Vue instance offers developers a streamlined way to manage and modify a website.
